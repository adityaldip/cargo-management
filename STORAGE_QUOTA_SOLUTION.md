# Storage Quota Management Solution

## Problem
When uploading large datasets (10k+ rows), the application encounters localStorage quota exceeded errors:
```
Failed to execute 'setItem' on 'Storage': Setting the value of 'cargo-data-storage' exceeded the quota.
```

## Solution Overview

This comprehensive solution implements multiple layers of storage quota management:

### 1. Enhanced Storage Utilities (`lib/storage-utils.ts`)

#### Progressive Cleanup Strategies
The system now implements 5 progressive cleanup strategies that execute in order when storage is full:

1. **cleanup_old_datasets**: Remove datasets older than 24 hours
2. **cleanup_file_storage**: Remove stored file data (base64 encoded files)
3. **cleanup_upload_sessions**: Clear upload session data
4. **cleanup_column_mappings**: Remove column mapping cache
5. **emergency_cleanup**: Clear all cargo-related data except essential session info

#### Storage Quota Monitoring
- `getStorageQuotaInfo()`: Real-time storage usage monitoring
- `performProgressiveCleanup()`: Automated cleanup with progress reporting
- `safeLocalStorageSetItem()`: Enhanced storage function with automatic cleanup

### 2. Data Store Improvements (`store/data-store.tsx`)

#### Lightweight Data Persistence
- **createLightweightDataset()**: Removes actual data arrays, keeps only summaries
- **createUltraLightweightDataset()**: Ultra-minimal version for extreme quota situations
- **Dynamic size estimation**: Automatically switches to ultra-lightweight mode when data is too large

#### Smart Partialize Strategy
```typescript
partialize: (state) => {
  // Automatically chooses between lightweight and ultra-lightweight based on size
  const estimatedSize = JSON.stringify(lightweightState).length * 2
  const maxSize = 2 * 1024 * 1024 // 2MB threshold
  
  if (estimatedSize > maxSize) {
    return ultraLightweightState // Even more minimal
  }
  return lightweightState
}
```

### 3. File Storage Enhancements (`lib/file-storage.ts`)

#### Quota-Aware File Storage
- Automatic cleanup of old files when quota exceeded
- Fallback to metadata-only storage when file data can't be stored
- Graceful degradation without breaking the user experience

### 4. User Interface Improvements

#### Storage Monitor Component (`components/ui/storage-monitor.tsx`)
- Real-time storage usage display
- Visual progress bar with color-coded status
- One-click cleanup functionality
- Automatic cleanup progress reporting

#### Import Component Updates
- Enhanced error handling for storage quota issues
- Automatic cleanup with user feedback
- Graceful degradation when storage is full
- Non-blocking operation (app continues to work even when storage fails)

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Storage Management
- **Progressive cleanup**: Automatically frees space using multiple strategies
- **Smart data reduction**: Reduces data size automatically when needed
- **Non-blocking errors**: Storage failures don't break the application

### 2. User Feedback
- **Storage monitor**: Visual indicator of storage usage
- **Cleanup notifications**: Users are informed when cleanup occurs
- **Error handling**: Clear messaging about storage issues

### 3. Data Preservation
- **Essential data priority**: Critical workflow data is preserved
- **Graceful degradation**: App functionality continues even with limited storage
- **Recovery mechanisms**: Data can be restored from Supabase when needed

## Usage Examples

### For Large Dataset Uploads (10k+ rows)

1. **Automatic Handling**: The system automatically detects quota issues and performs cleanup
2. **User Notification**: Users see storage warnings and cleanup progress
3. **Continued Operation**: Upload and processing continue even if some session data can't be stored

### Storage Monitor Integration
```typescript
// Add to any component that handles large data
import { StorageMonitor } from "./ui/storage-monitor"

// In component JSX
<StorageMonitor />
```

### Manual Cleanup
```typescript
import { performProgressiveCleanup } from "@/lib/storage-utils"

const handleCleanup = async () => {
  const result = await performProgressiveCleanup((strategy, description, itemsRemoved) => {
    console.log(`${description} - ${itemsRemoved} items removed`)
  })
  
  if (result.success) {
    console.log(`Cleanup successful: ${result.totalItemsRemoved} items removed`)
  }
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Size Limits
- **2MB threshold**: Switches to ultra-lightweight mode
- **5MB estimation**: Fallback storage limit assumption
- **Progressive reduction**: Multiple levels of data reduction

### Error Recovery
- **Try-catch blocks**: All storage operations are wrapped in error handling
- **Fallback strategies**: Multiple backup approaches for each operation
- **User communication**: Clear error messages and recovery suggestions

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy loading**: Storage operations are async and non-blocking
- **Batch operations**: Cleanup strategies execute efficiently
- **Memory management**: Automatic cleanup of test data and temporary variables

## Benefits

1. **Handles Large Datasets**: Successfully processes 10k+ row files
2. **User-Friendly**: Clear feedback and automatic problem resolution
3. **Robust**: Multiple fallback strategies prevent complete failures
4. **Non-Disruptive**: App continues working even with storage constraints
5. **Automatic**: Minimal user intervention required
6. **Recoverable**: Data can be restored from database when needed

## Migration Notes

- Existing stored data remains compatible
- New storage management is backward compatible
- Users may see one-time cleanup notifications as old data is optimized
- Performance improvements are immediately available

This solution ensures that large dataset uploads (10k+ rows) work reliably while providing users with clear feedback about storage usage and automatic problem resolution.
